# ETK4J
Engineering Toolkit for Java

This is a project that I work on on my spare time. The purpose of the project
is to have a centralized library that's 100% in Java that allows one to prototype solutions
to engineering problems. 

The linear algebra part of the library was taken from [Jama](https://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/)
and the internal data representation was changed from 2d array of doubles to a 1d array of doubles
and the values are accessed via an offset.

There's a set of examples that show how to use some of the classes contained in the library. The examples
can be found
